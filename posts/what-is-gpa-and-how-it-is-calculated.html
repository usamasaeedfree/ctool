        <h2>Introduction to GPA</h2>
        <h3>What is GPA?</h3>
        <p>GPA, or Grade Point Average, is a numerical value that measures a student's academic performance. In simple
            terms, GPA is the average of your grades converted into points. It's a kind of summary number on your
            academic report card that helps both universities and employers understand your consistency and performance.
        </p>

        <br>
        <h3>Why GPA Is Important for Students</h3>
        <p>GPA is very important for every student's career. Universities evaluate GPA for admission decisions,
            scholarships, and providing internships. A high GPA represents a student's discipline, focus, and knowledge
            level. From real experience, when I consistently maintained a 3.7+ GPA in my bachelor's, I not only got
            scholarships, but internship opportunities also became easier for me.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>GPA in Schools, Colleges, and Universities</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>At the school level, GPA mainly motivates students to strengthen their basics.</li>
            <li>At the college level, GPA decides what specialization or major you will get a chance to pursue.</li>
            <li>At the university level, GPA is a critical factor in future opportunities (scholarships, graduate
                programs, jobs).</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding the GPA System</h2>
        <h3>How GPA Reflects Academic Performance</h3>
        <p>GPA is a cumulative performance indicator. If you are weak in one subject and strong in another, your GPA
            shows the balance of both. It provides a holistic picture of the student's overall performance.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Different GPA Scales (4.0, 5.0, 10.0)</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>4.0 scale (USA, Pakistan, Canada): Most common, A=4.0, B=3.0, etc.</li>
            <li>5.0 scale (some schools): For advanced courses or honors classes.</li>
            <li>10.0 scale (India and Europe): Wide range for detailed performance differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>GPA vs. Percentage vs. Grades</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>Percentage = Raw score (e.g., 85%)</li>
            <li>Grades = Alphabetical representation (A, B, C)</li>
            <li>GPA = Grade point average converted to numeric points</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Misalignment happens when students use GPA and percentage directly, which is not correct.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Common Misconceptions About GPA</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The grade of just one subject does not have much impact; the cumulative average of multiple subjects
                matters.</li>
            <li>Having a high GPA is important, but skills and extracurriculars are equally important.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>How is GPA Calculated?</h2>
        <h3>Basic Formula of GPA</h3>
        <p>It is the basic formula that is used everywhere to calculate the GPA of subjects and semesters.</p>

        <p><Strong>GPA = Total Grade Points / Total Credit Hours</Strong></p>

        <br>
        <h3>Credit Hours and Their Role in GPA Calculation</h3>
        <p>Each course has a weight, which is decided by credit hours. For example, a 3-credit-hour course will have
            more impact than a 1-credit-hour course.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Weighted vs. Unweighted GPA</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>Unweighted GPA: Simple average, maximum 4.0 scale.</li>
            <li>Weighted GPA: Honors/AP courses are weighted the same as the 5.0 scale.</li>
        </ul>


        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>Step-by-Step Example of GPA Calculation</h2>
        <h3>Example 1 - Single Subject GPA</h3>
        <p>Suppose a course has 3 credit hours and the student received an "A" grade (4.0 points):</p>
        <span><strong>Example:</strong></span>
        <p><strong>GPA = 3 x 4.0 / 3 = 4.0</strong></p>


        <br>
        <h3>Example 2 - Multiple Subjects GPA</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>English (3 CH, Grade B=3.0) → 9 points</li>
            <li>Math (4 CH, Grade A=4.0) → 16 points</li>
            <li>Physics (2 CH, Grade C=2.0) → 4 points</li>
        </ul>

        <span><strong>Example:</strong></span>
        <p><strong>GGPA = 9 = 16 + 4 / 3 + 4 + 2 = 29 / 9 = 3.22</strong></p>

        <h2>How to Improve Your GPA</h2>
        <h3>Study Habits and Time Management</h3>
        <p>Avoid short daily study sessions and last-minute cramming.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Using Academic Resources (Tutors, Study Groups)</h3>
        <p>Peer study groups are very helpful in understanding complex topics.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Managing Course Load Effectively</h3>
        <p>Maintain a balance between difficult and easy courses.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Real-Life Tips from Top Students</h3>
        <p>One of my seniors had said, "Consistency is more important than studying 10 hours once a week. Even 1 hour a
            day can dramatically improve GPA."</p>

        <h2>GPA Tools and Resources</h2>
        <h3>Online GPA Calculators</h3>
        <p>A <a href="/tools/tools.html" class="clr">web-based tool</a> where you can enter your rates and credit hours and instantly calculate the GPA.</p>

        <p>Personally, whenever I have to calculate my GPA, I prefer online automatic calculators over the
            manual method. In manual calculations, credit hours and grade points have to be multiplied and divided again
            and again, in which the chances of errors are very high. Online tools instantly give accurate results and
            also save time. For me, the most reliable tool is <a href="/tools/tools.html" class="clr">Online GPA Calculator by ctool.fun</a>, where I just enter
            grades and credit hours, and I get the exact GPA in one click. That is why I always use online automatic
            calculators for my academic planning.</p>


        <br>
        <h3>GPA Conversion Charts</h3>
        <p>It is necessary to use the official university charts for percentage-to-GPA conversion.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>University Guidelines for GPA</h3>
        <p>Each university has its own grading policy, so be sure to check the official handbook.</p>
