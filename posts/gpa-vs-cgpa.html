        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Nowadays, the focus is not just on studying and getting good marks. Today, the grading system has also become
            an important factor. Whether you are in school, college, or preparing for the next exam, it is very
            important to understand your grades and use them correctly.</p>

        <p>Earlier, people used to focus only on marks (numbers), but now grades (such as A, B, C) also matter a great
            deal. The grading system shows your performance in a structured way.

        </p>

        <p>This system mainly uses two grading scales worldwide: GPA (Grade Point Average) and CGPA (Cumulative Grade
            Point Average). But a common confusion among students is “What is the difference between GPA and CGPA?” and
            “Which is more important - CGPA vs GPA?”</p>

        <p>In this article, we will see step by step what GPA and CGPA are, how they are calculated, what the key
            differences between them are, and which strategies you should follow to improve them.</p>


        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>What is GPA?</h2>
        <p>The full form of GPA is Grade Point Average. It is a numerical value that represents your performance over a
            semester or a specific time period.</p>

        <p>In simple terms, GPA is a short-term indicator that reflects the average performance of your courses in a
            semester.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>How GPA Is Calculated</h3>
        <h4>Formula of GPA</h4>
        <p>This is the general formula for calculating grade point average:</p>
        <p>GPA = (Total Grade Points Earned * Credit Hours) / Total Credit Hours Attempted</p>

        <p>Role of Credit Hours in GPA</p>
        <p>Credit hours play a crucial role because each course has a different weightage. For example, a 3-credit
            course will have more weight as compared to a 1-credit course. If you score a lower grade in a 3-credit
            course, it will have a stronger negative impact on your GPA.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>Types of GPA</h3>
        <p>Semester GPA vs Cumulative GPA</p>
        <ul class="links">
            <li><strong>Semester GPA: </strong>It only measures the performance of a particular semester.</li>
            <li><strong>Cumulative GPA: </strong>Calculates the average of multiple semesters, but it is still not as
                long-term as CGPA.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Weighted vs Unweighted GPA</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li><strong>Unweighted GPA: </strong>Usually, it is on a scale of 0–4, giving equal weightage to all
                courses.</li>
            <li><strong>Weighted GPA: </strong>Honors, AP, or advanced courses have extra weight (e.g., on a 5.0 scale).
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Real-life Example: GPA Calculation for a Single Semester</h3>
        <p>Suppose you took 4 courses in one semester:</p>

        <ul class="links">
            <li><strong>Total Credit Hours </strong>= 12</li>
            <li><strong>Total Weighted Points </strong>= 38</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>GPA = 38 ÷ 12 = 3.16</strong>




        <br>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <h2>What is CGPA?</h2>
        <strong>Definition of CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average)</strong>
        <p>CGPA stands for Cumulative Grade Point Average. It is a performance indicator of your overall academic
            journey. In simple words, CGPA is the cumulative average of all semester GPAs.</p>

        <br>
        <h3>How CGPA Is Calculated</h3>
        <p>This is the formula used to calculate CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average).</p>
        <strong>CGPA = Total Grade Points Earned in All Semesters ÷ Total Credit Hours in All Semesters</strong>

        <p>GPA to CGPA Conversion (with Example)</p>
        <p>Suppose this is your semester's GPA:</p>

        <ul class="links">
            <li>Semester 1 = 3.2</li>
            <li>Semester 2 = 3.5</li>
            <li>Semester 3 = 3.8</li>
            <li>Semester 4 = 3.4</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>CGPA = (3.2 + 3.5 + 3.8 + 3.4) ÷ 4 = 3.475</strong>


        <br>
        <h3>Importance of CGPA</h3>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>Role in Overall Academic Performance</li>
            <li>CGPA shows the long-term consistency of a student. If one semester’s GPA is a little low, but the rest
                are strong, the CGPA remains stable.</li>
            <li>Significance for Higher Education & Job Applications</li>
            <li>Universities and employers often consider CGPA because it reflects a student’s entire academic journey.
                CGPA matters a lot in admissions, scholarships, and placements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Which is More Important: GPA or CGPA?</h2>
        <ul class="links">
            <li>Universities & Employers' View: CGPA is more important as it shows overall performance.</li>
            <li>For scholarships and international admissions, CGPA is often a deciding factor.</li>
            <li>GPA matters more when a student wants to show recent improvement in a specific semester or meet the
                requirements of a particular program.</li>

        <ul class="links">
            <li><strong>“GPA and CGPA are the same” </strong>– Absolutely wrong, GPA is for one semester, CGPA is for
                overall.</li>
            <li><strong>“High GPA means high CGPA” </strong>– Not necessary, having high GPAs in just one or two
                semesters does not improve the overall CGPA significantly.</li>
            <li><strong>“Employers only look at GPA” </strong>– In reality, both are looked at, but CGPA carries more
                weight.</li>

        <h2>Global Grading Scales You Should Know</h2>
        <p>The grading scale for GPA and CGPA is not the same worldwide. Different countries and universities use
            different scales:</p>
        <ul class="links">
            <li><strong>USA & Canada: </strong>GPA is calculated on a 4.0 scale (sometimes 5.0 for weighted GPAs).</li>
            <li><strong>India: </strong>CGPA is usually on a 10-point scale (converted later into percentages for
                jobs/admissions).</li>
            <li><strong>Pakistan: </strong> Most universities follow a 4.0 CGPA scale, similar to the US.</li>
            <li><strong>Europe (e.g., France, Germany): </strong> Some institutions use 20-point or percentage-based
                systems.</li>
            <li><strong>UK: </strong>Universities mostly use class-based grading (First Class, Upper Second, etc.), not
                GPA.</li>
        </ul>

            student.</p>
        <p>The best approach is to stay consistent, improve weak areas, and regularly track your performance. By using
            GPA/CGPA calculators, you can accurately track your progress.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, both GPA vs CGPA play an important role in shaping your academic and career opportunities.</p>
